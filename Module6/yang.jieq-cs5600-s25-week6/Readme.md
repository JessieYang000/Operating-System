# Module 6

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This program generates random strings, processes them using a queue, and encodes them using the **Polybius cipher** in batches. The encoding is performed by a separate process using **pipes** for inter-process communication. The encoded strings are saved into output files.


## âœ… How to Use:
- Automate the compilation and build process of this program
```make```
- Run the compiled program main with three command-line arguments.
 - arg1: the number of random strings(at least 10000)
 - arg2: the length of each string
 - arg3: the filename to store the random strings
### Example: 
```./main 10000 5 output.txt```

After running this command, the program prints progress messages like:
```Writing 10000 random strings with length 10 to output.txt...
Random strings successfully written to output.txt.
Saving strings from file output.txt into queue...
Successfully generated output_batch_0.txt
Successfully generated output_batch_1.txt
...
```
