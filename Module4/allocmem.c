/* What happened when the program exits or the associated process is deleted? 
1. Heap memory(allocated by malloc()): Freed by free(), but even if not freed, the OS reclaims it.
2. Stack memory (local variables): Automatically released when functions return, and fully cleared when the process exits.
3. Static segment: Reclaimed when the process is removed.

Even if the program does not free its memory manually, the OS ensures no memory leak persists after termination.
